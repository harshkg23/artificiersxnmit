                <h3>Detection Methods</h3>
                <p id="para">Lung cancer detection typically begins with a thorough medical history and physical
                    examination by a healthcare
                    professional. If lung cancer is suspected based on symptoms or risk factors such as smoking history,
                    the next step
                    usually involves imaging tests such as chest X-rays, CT scans, or PET scans. These tests help
                    visualize the lungs and
                    any abnormalities that may indicate the presence of cancerous growths or tumors. In some cases, a
                    biopsy may be
                    performed to collect tissue samples from the lungs for further analysis under a microscope.
                    Additionally, advanced
                    imaging techniques such as MRI or bronchoscopy may be utilized to provide detailed views of the
                    lungs and surrounding
                    tissues. Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment, and prompt diagnosis
                    allows for timely
                    intervention and improved outcomes for patients."</p>

                <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
                <p id="para">The symptoms of lung cancer often manifest as subtle signs that may be overlooked or
                    attributed to other causes,
                    especially in the early stages of the disease. Persistent coughing that worsens over time, coughing
                    up blood or
                    rust-colored sputum, and chronic chest pain or discomfort are among the most common symptoms.
                    Shortness of breath,
                    wheezing, and hoarseness may also occur, particularly as the cancer progresses and affects lung
                    function. Some
                    individuals may experience unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fatigue, or recurrent
                    respiratory infections.
                    Additionally, lung cancer can cause bone pain, headaches, and swelling in the neck or face if the
                    cancer spreads to
                    other parts of the body. It's essential to recognize these symptoms and seek medical attention
                    promptly for further
                    evaluation and diagnosis</p>

                <h3>Types of Lung Cancer</h3>
                <p id="para">Lung cancer comprises two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell
                    lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC
                    includes subtypes like adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, with
                    adenocarcinoma being the
                    most common. SCLC, accounting for about 15% of cases, is aggressive and characterized by small,
                    rapidly spreading cancer
                    cells, strongly linked to smoking. These distinctions guide treatment and prognosis.</p>

                <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
                <p id="para">Treatment options for lung cancer are diverse and tailored to individual cases. Surgery
                    involves removing the tumor and
                    nearby tissue, while chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Radiation
                    therapy targets cancer
                    cells with high-energy rays, often used in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. Targeted
                    therapy focuses on
                    specific abnormalities in cancer cells, while immunotherapy boosts the body's immune system to fight
                    cancer. These
                    treatments may be used alone or in combination, depending on factors such as cancer type, stage, and
                    patient health.</p>
